## About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a simple API written with TypeScript, and using Express as a framework. It allows Customer service agents rectify customer complaints without much need for the Backend team.

Agents can perform operations depending on their clearance level, which ranges from 1-3.
The higher the clearance level, the more the sophistication of resolution

Admin Clearance Level is required to clear an employee as a Customer Service Agent, and also required to upgrade an agent Clearance Level.
